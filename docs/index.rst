Welcome to Recogners' documentation!
=======================================

Did you ever reach a bottleneck in your computational experiments? Are you tired of implementing your own techniques? If yes, Recogners is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of machine learning algorithms. From datasets to fully-customizable models, from internal functions to external communication, we will foster all research related to machine learning.

Use Recogners if you need a library or wish to:

* Create your own machine learning algorithm.
* Design or use pre-loaded learners.
* Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem.
* Because it is incredible to learn things.

Recogners is compatible with: **Python 3.6+** and **PyPy 3.5**.
